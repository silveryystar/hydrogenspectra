# Hydrogen Spectral Series
Records and plots line wavelengths of named hydrogen spectral series.

# Setup
1. Install Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download repository.
3. Open Terminal in repository folder.
4. Enter `pip install matplotlib`.
5. Enter `python main.py`.

# Information
`f.py` builds all function used in `main.py`.
`main.py` runs the code, generating _Figure_0_, _Figure_1_, and `lines.txt`.

`lines.txt` contains the hydrogen spectral line wavelengths (in nm) and the various series to which they belong.
In `lines.txt`, _i_ is the "infinite" spectral line.
This is the spectral line that appears when the higher energy level approaches the limit of infinity.
